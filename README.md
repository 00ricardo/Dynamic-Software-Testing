# Dynamic-Software-Testing
Dynamic Software Testing

The goal of this assignment is to develop a software test plan and perform the testing
campaign for a software code selected by the students (see details and requirements for
selecting the code to be tested below in point 1). An important aspect is in the fact that the
assignment should be regarded as an exploratory software testing exercise. That is, each
group of students is expected to identify and select the most appropriate testing approaches,
taking into account the topics covered in the T classes, and tools available at the Internet,
instead of just following a predetermined testing script and using mandatory tools.
Additionally, the focus is on dynamic testing, which means that static approaches (e.g., static
code analysis, code inspections, etc.) are out of the scope of the assignment.
